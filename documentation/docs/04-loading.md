title: Loading
---

A component that defines a page or a layout can export a `load` function that runs before the component is created. This function runs both during server-side rendering and in the client, and allows you to fetch and manipulate data before the page is rendered, thus preventing loading spinners.

If the data for a page comes from its endpoint, you may not need a `load` function. It's useful when you need more flexibility, for example loading data from an external API, which might look like this:

```html
/// file: src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte
<script context="module">
	/** @type {import('./[slug]').Load} */
	export async function load({ params, fetch, session, stuff }) {
		const url = `https://cms.example.com/article/${params.slug}.json`;
		const response = await fetch(url);

		return {
			status: response.status,
			props: {
				article: response.ok && (await response.json())
			}
		};
	}
</script>
```

> Note the `<script context="module">` — this is necessary because `load` runs before the component is rendered. Code that is per-component instance should go into a second `<script>` tag.

As with [endpoints](/docs/routing#endpoints), pages can import [generated types](/docs/types#generated) — the `./[slug]` in the example above — to ensure that `params` are correctly typed.

`load` is similar to `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` in Next.js, except that `load` runs on both the server and the client. In the example above, if a user clicks on a link to this page the data will be fetched from `cms.example.com` without going via our server.

SvelteKit's `load` receives an implementation of `fetch`, which has the following special properties:

- it has access to cookies on the server
- it can make requests against the app's own endpoints without issuing an HTTP call
- it makes a copy of the response when you use it, and then sends it embedded in the initial page load for hydration

`load` only applies to [page](/docs/routing#pages) and [layout](/docs/layouts) components (not components they import), and runs on both the server and in the browser with the default rendering options.

> Code called inside `load` blocks:
>
> - should use the SvelteKit-provided [`fetch`](/docs/loading#input-fetch) wrapper rather than using the native `fetch`
> - should not reference `window`, `document`, or any browser-specific objects
> - should not directly reference any API keys or secrets, which will be exposed to the client, but instead call an endpoint that uses any required secrets

It is recommended that you not store per-request state in global variables, but instead use them only for cross-cutting concerns such as caching and holding database connections.

> Mutating any shared state on the server will affect all clients, not just the current one.

### Input

The `load` function receives an object containing eight fields — `url`, `params`, `props`, `fetch`, `session`, `stuff`, `status`, and `error`. The `load` function is reactive, and will re-run when its parameters change, but only if they are used in the function. Specifically, if `url`, `session` or `stuff` are used in the function, they will be re-run whenever their value changes, and likewise for the individual properties of `params`.

> Note that destructuring parameters in the function declaration is enough to count as using them.

#### url

`url` is an instance of [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL), containing properties like the `origin`, `hostname`, `pathname` and `searchParams` (which contains the parsed query string as a [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) object).

> In some environments this is derived from request headers during server-side rendering. If you're using [adapter-node](/docs/adapters#supported-environments-node-js), for example, you may need to configure the adapter in order for the URL to be correct.

#### params

`params` is derived from `url.pathname` and the route filename.

For a route filename example like `src/routes/a/[b]/[...c]` and a `url.pathname` of `/a/x/y/z`, the `params` object would look like this:

```json
{
	"b": "x",
	"c": "y/z"
}
```

#### props

If the page you're loading has an endpoint, the data returned from it is accessible inside the leaf component's `load` function as `props`. For layout components and pages without endpoints, `props` will be an empty object.

#### fetch

`fetch` is equivalent to the native `fetch` web API, and can make credentialed requests. It can be used across both client and server contexts.

> When `fetch` runs on the server, the resulting response will be serialized and inlined into the rendered HTML. This allows the subsequent client-side `load` to access identical data immediately without an additional network request.

> Cookies will only be passed through if the target host is the same as the SvelteKit application or a more specific subdomain of it.

#### session

`session` can be used to pass data from the server related to the current request, e.g. the current user. By default it is `undefined`. See [`getSession`](/docs/hooks#getsession) to learn how to use it.

#### stuff

`stuff` is passed from layouts to descendant layouts and pages, and can be filled with anything else you need to make available. For the root `__layout.svelte` component, it is equal to `{}`, but if that component's `load` function returns an object with a `stuff` property, it will be available to subsequent `load` functions.

#### status

`status` is the HTTP status code when rendering an error page, or `null` otherwise.

#### error

`error` is the error that was thrown (or returned from a previous `load`) when rendering an error page, or `null` otherwise.

### Output

If you return a Promise from `load`, SvelteKit will delay rendering until the promise resolves. The return value has several properties listed below, all of which are optional.

> `status`, `error`, `redirect` and `cache` are ignored when rendering error pages.

#### status

The HTTP status code for the page. If returning an `error` this must be a `4xx` or `5xx` response; if returning a `redirect` it must be a `3xx` response. The default is `200`.

#### error

If something goes wrong during `load`, return an `Error` object or a `string` describing the error alongside a `4xx` or `5xx` status code.

#### redirect

If the page should redirect (because the page is deprecated, or the user needs to be logged in, or whatever else) return a `string` containing the location to which they should be redirected alongside a `3xx` status code.

The `redirect` string should be a [properly encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding) URI. Both absolute and relative URIs are acceptable.

#### cache

```json
cache: {
	"maxage": 300,
	"private": false
}
```

To cause pages to be cached, return a `cache` object containing a `maxage` property set to a `number` describing the page's max age in seconds. Optionally, also include a `boolean` `private` property indicating whether the resulting `Cache-Control` header should be `private` or `public` (meaning it can be cached by CDNs in addition to individual browsers).

> If `cache.private` is `undefined`, SvelteKit will set it automatically using the following heuristic: if a `load` function makes a credentialled `fetch`, or the page uses `session`, the page is considered private.

This only applies to pages, _not_ layouts.

#### props

If the `load` function returns a `props` object, the props will be passed to the component when it is rendered.

#### stuff

This will be merged with any existing `stuff` and passed to the `load` functions of subsequent layout and page components.

The combined `stuff` is available to components using the [page store](/docs/modules#$app-stores) as `$page.stuff`, providing a mechanism for pages to pass data 'upward' to layouts.

#### dependencies

An array of strings representing URLs the page depends on, which can subsequently be used with [`invalidate`](/docs/modules#$app-navigation-invalidate) to cause `load` to rerun. You only need to add them to `dependencies` if you're using a custom API client; URLs loaded with the provided `fetch` function are added automatically.

URLs can be absolute or relative to the page being loaded, and must be [encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding).
