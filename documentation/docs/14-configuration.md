title: Configuration
---

Your project's configuration lives in a `svelte.config.js` file. All values are optional. The complete list of options, with defaults, is shown here:

```js
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	// options passed to svelte.compile (https://svelte.dev/docs#compile-time-svelte-compile)
	compilerOptions: null,

	// an array of file extensions that should be treated as Svelte components
	extensions: ['.svelte'],

	kit: {
		adapter: null,
		amp: false,
		appDir: '_app',
		browser: {
			hydrate: true,
			router: true
		},
		csp: {
			mode: 'auto',
			directives: {
				'default-src': undefined
				// ...
			}
		},
		files: {
			assets: 'static',
			hooks: 'src/hooks',
			lib: 'src/lib',
			routes: 'src/routes',
			serviceWorker: 'src/service-worker',

		},
		floc: false,
		inlineStyleThreshold: 0,
		methodOverride: {
			parameter: '_method',
			allowed: []
		},
		package: {
			dir: 'package',
			emitTypes: true,
			// excludes all .d.ts and files starting with _ as the name
			exports: (filepath) => !/^_|\/_|\.d\.ts$/.test(filepath),
			files: () => true
		},
		paths: {
			assets: '',
			base: ''
		},
		prerender: {
			concurrency: 1,
			crawl: true,
			enabled: true,
			entries: ['*'],
			onError: 'fail'
		},
		routes: (filepath) => !/(?:(?:^_|\/_)|(?:^\.|\/\.)(?!well-known))/.test(filepath),
		serviceWorker: {

			files: (filepath) => !/\.DS_Store/.test(filepath)
		},
		trailingSlash: 'never',
		version: {
			name: Date.now().toString(),
			pollInterval: 0
		},
		vite: () => ({})
	},

	// SvelteKit uses vite-plugin-svelte. Its options can be provided directly here.
	// See the available options at https://github.com/sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte/blob/main/docs/config.md

	// options passed to svelte.preprocess (https://svelte.dev/docs#compile-time-svelte-preprocess)
	preprocess: null
};

export default config;
```

### adapter

Required when running `svelte-kit build` and determines how the output is converted for different platforms. See [Adapters](/docs/adapters).

### amp

Enable [AMP](/docs/amp) mode.

### appDir

The directory relative to `paths.assets` where the built JS and CSS (and imported assets) are served from. (The filenames therein contain content-based hashes, meaning they can be cached indefinitely). Must not start or end with `/`.

### browser

An object containing zero or more of the following `boolean` values:

- `hydrate` — whether to [hydrate](/docs/page-options#hydrate) the server-rendered HTML with a client-side app. (It's rare that you would set this to `false` on an app-wide basis.)
- `router` — enables or disables the client-side [router](/docs/page-options#router) app-wide.

### csp

An object containing zero or more of the following values:

- `mode` — 'hash', 'nonce' or 'auto'
- `directives` — an object of `[directive]: value[]` pairs.

[Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) configuration. CSP helps to protect your users against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by limiting the places resources can be loaded from. For example, a configuration like this...

```js
{
	directives: {
		'script-src': ['self']
	}
}
```

...would prevent scripts loading from external sites. SvelteKit will augment the specified directives with nonces or hashes (depending on `mode`) for any inline styles and scripts it generates.

When pages are prerendered, the CSP header is added via a `<meta http-equiv>` tag (note that in this case, `frame-ancestors`, `report-uri` and `sandbox` directives will be ignored).

> When `mode` is `'auto'`, SvelteKit will use nonces for dynamically rendered pages and hashes for prerendered pages. Using nonces with prerendered pages is insecure and therefore forbiddem.

### files

An object containing zero or more of the following `string` values:

- `assets` — a place to put static files that should have stable URLs and undergo no processing, such as `favicon.ico` or `manifest.json`
- `hooks` — the location of your hooks module (see [Hooks](/docs/hooks))
- `lib` — your app's internal library, accessible throughout the codebase as `$lib`
- `routes` — the files that define the structure of your app (see [Routing](/docs/routing))
- `serviceWorker` — the location of your service worker's entry point (see [Service workers](/docs/service-workers))
- `template` — the location of the template for HTML responses

### floc

Google's [FLoC](https://github.com/WICG/floc) is a technology for targeted advertising that the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) has deemed [harmful](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea) to user privacy. [Browsers other than Chrome](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387492/google-floc-ad-tech-privacy-browsers-brave-vivaldi-edge-mozilla-chrome-safari) have declined to implement it.

In common with services like [GitHub Pages](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-27-github-pages-permissions-policy-interest-cohort-header-added-to-all-pages-sites/), SvelteKit protects your users by automatically opting out of FLoC. It adds the following header to responses unless `floc` is `true`:

```
Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort=()
```

> This only applies to server-rendered responses — headers for prerendered pages (e.g. created with [adapter-static](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static)) are determined by the hosting platform.

### inlineStyleThreshold

Inline CSS inside a `<style>` block at the head of the HTML. This option is a number that specifies the maximum length of a CSS file to be inlined. All CSS files needed for the page and smaller than this value are merged and inlined in a `<style>` block.

> This results in fewer initial requests and can improve your [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint) score. However, it generates larger HTML output and reduces the effectiveness of browser caches. Use it advisedly.

### methodOverride

See [HTTP Method Overrides](/docs/routing#endpoints-http-method-overrides). An object containing zero or more of the following:

- `parameter` — query parameter name to use for passing the intended method value
- `allowed` - array of HTTP methods that can be used when overriding the original request method

### package

Options related to [creating a package](/docs/packaging).

- `dir` - output directory
- `emitTypes` - by default, `svelte-kit package` will automatically generate types for your package in the form of `.d.ts` files. While generating types is configurable, we believe it is best for the ecosystem quality to generate types, always. Please make sure you have a good reason when setting it to `false` (for example when you want to provide handwritten type definitions instead)
- `exports` - a function with the type of `(filepath: string) => boolean`. When `true`, the filepath will be included in the `exports` field of the `package.json`. Any existing values in the `package.json` source will be merged with values from the original `exports` field taking precedence
- `files` - a function with the type of `(filepath: string) => boolean`. When `true`, the file will be processed and copied over to the final output folder, specified in `dir`

For advanced `filepath` matching, you can use `exports` and `files` options in conjunction with a globbing library:

```js
// svelte.config.js
import mm from 'micromatch';

export default {
	kit: {
		package: {
			exports: (filepath) => {
				if (filepath.endsWith('.d.ts')) return false;
				return mm.isMatch(filepath, ['!**/_*', '!**/internal/**']);
			},
			files: mm.matcher('!**/build.*')
		}
	}
};
```

### paths

An object containing zero or more of the following `string` values:

- `assets` — an absolute path that your app's files are served from. This is useful if your files are served from a storage bucket of some kind
- `base` — a root-relative path that must start, but not end with `/` (e.g. `/base-path`). This specifies where your app is served from and allows the app to live on a non-root path

### prerender

See [Prerendering](/docs/page-options#prerender). An object containing zero or more of the following:

- `concurrency` — how many pages can be prerendered simultaneously. JS is single-threaded, but in cases where prerendering performance is network-bound (for example loading content from a remote CMS) this can speed things up by processing other tasks while waiting on the network response
- `crawl` — determines whether SvelteKit should find pages to prerender by following links from the seed page(s)
- `enabled` — set to `false` to disable prerendering altogether
- `entries` — an array of pages to prerender, or start crawling from (if `crawl: true`). The `*` string includes all non-dynamic routes (i.e. pages with no `[parameters]` )
- `onError`

  - `'fail'` — (default) fails the build when a routing error is encountered when following a link
  - `'continue'` — allows the build to continue, despite routing errors
  - `function` — custom error handler allowing you to log, `throw` and fail the build, or take other action of your choosing based on the details of the crawl

    ```ts
    import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
    /** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').PrerenderErrorHandler} */
    const handleError = ({ status, path, referrer, referenceType }) => {
    	if (path.startsWith('/blog')) throw new Error('Missing a blog page!');
    	console.warn(`${status} ${path}${referrer ? ` (${referenceType} from ${referrer})` : ''}`);
    };

    export default {
    	kit: {
    		adapter: adapter(),
    		prerender: {
    			onError: handleError
    		}
    	}
    };
    ```

### routes

A `(filepath: string) => boolean` function that determines which files create routes and which are treated as [private modules](/docs/routing#private-modules).

### serviceWorker

An object containing zero or more of the following values:

- `register` - if set to `false`, will disable automatic service worker registration
- `files` - a function with the type of `(filepath: string) => boolean`. When `true`, the given file will be available in `$service-worker.files`, otherwise it will be excluded.

### trailingSlash

Whether to remove, append, or ignore trailing slashes when resolving URLs to routes.

- `"never"` — redirect `/x/` to `/x`
- `"always"` — redirect `/x` to `/x/`
- `"ignore"` — don't automatically add or remove trailing slashes. `/x` and `/x/` will be treated equivalently

This option also affects [prerendering](/docs/page-options#prerender). If `trailingSlash` is `always`, a route like `/about` will result in an `about/index.html` file, otherwise it will create `about.html`, mirroring static webserver conventions.

> Ignoring trailing slashes is not recommended — the semantics of relative paths differ between the two cases (`./y` from `/x` is `/y`, but from `/x/` is `/x/y`), and `/x` and `/x/` are treated as separate URLs which is harmful to SEO. If you use this option, ensure that you implement logic for conditionally adding or removing trailing slashes from `request.path` inside your [`handle`](/docs/hooks#handle) function.

### version

An object containing zero or more of the following values:

- `name` - current app version string
- `pollInterval` - interval in milliseconds to poll for version changes

Client-side navigation can be buggy if you deploy a new version of your app while people are using it. If the code for the new page is already loaded, it may have stale content; if it isn't, the app's route manifest may point to a JavaScript file that no longer exists. SvelteKit solves this problem by falling back to traditional full-page navigation if it detects that a new version has been deployed, using the `name` specified here (which defaults to a timestamp of the build).

If you set `pollInterval` to a non-zero value, SvelteKit will poll for new versions in the background and set the value of the [`updated`](/docs/modules#$app-stores) store to `true` when it detects one.

### vite

A [Vite config object](https://vitejs.dev/config), or a function that returns one. You can pass [Vite and Rollup plugins](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#plugins) via [the `plugins` option](https://vitejs.dev/config/#plugins) to customize your build in advanced ways such as supporting image optimization, Tauri, WASM, Workbox, and more. SvelteKit will prevent you from setting certain build-related options since it depends on certain configuration values.
